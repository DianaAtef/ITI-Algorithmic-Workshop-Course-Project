# Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input image Pixels, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding pixels. The most frequent pixels gets the smallest code and the least frequent pixels gets the largest code
